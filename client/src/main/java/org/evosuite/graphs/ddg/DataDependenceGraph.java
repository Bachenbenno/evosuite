/**
 * Captures potential data dependencies between methods that stem from writing to and subsequently
 * reading from the same (static) class attribute. (The idea is closely related to the concept
 * of data dependencies on the statement-level, but instead of statements, we consider methods,
 * and instead of local variables, we consider attributes of classes.)
 * <p>
 * The graph contains two kinds of vertices: method vertices representing methods, and field
 * vertices representing fields (a.k.a. attributes of classes). Method vertices are implemented
 * by the {@code MethodEntry} class, and field vertices by the {@code FieldEntry} class.
 * <p>
 * The graph is directed. The direction of the edges encodes whether a field is read from or
 * written to. For example, an edge from a method {@code foo()} to a field {@code x} denotes that
 * {@code foo()} writes {@code x}. Similarly, an edge from a field {@code y} to a method {@code bar}
 * indicates that {@code y} is read by {@code bar()}. Field vertices can only be connected to
 * method vertices and vice versa. That is, there are no direct connections between two field
 * vertices or two method vertices. (This is similar to red-black trees where a red node must only
 * be connected to a black node and vice versa. There are no connections between two nodes of the
 * same color.)
 * <p>
 * There is a potential data dependency between two methods {@code foo()} and {@code bar()} if
 * they are connected to the same field node, while one methods writes the field and the other
 * method reads the field. For example, a method {@code foo()} writing an attribute {@code x} and a
 * method {@code bar()} reading the same attribute {@code x} induces a potential data dependency
 * between {@code foo()} and {@code bar()}. A method can have data dependencies to itself.
